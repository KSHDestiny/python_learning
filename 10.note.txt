Memory Management
    Code that decides what's kept in memory and what's thrown away

Memory Leak
    The amount of memory used by a program continues to grow unnecessarily

Garbage Collection
    An automated memory management process that keeps track of which items aren't needed and deletes them

Thread & Multi-Threading
    - Computer programs can be faster and more responsive by structuring them to do multiple things at once.
    - To do this, you can structure your code to start separate tasks that are executed simultaneously. 
    - Each task is known as a thread, and the overall approach to writing code that executes threads concurrently is known as multi-threading. 
    - Each thread in a multi-threaded program requires additional processing power and memory from the computer where the code is being executed. 
    - A computer's resources are finite though, so it's important to balance the benefits of multi-threading with the potential performance impacts on the computer as a whole. 
    - Consuming too much processor power or computer memory can slow the entire computer system, which cancels out any increase in responsiveness from splitting code into multiple threads.

// Many languages including Python support multi-threading. You may hear the term asynchronous code in relation to other languages like JavaScript. It's not exactly the same as multi-threading, but it's very similar.
